## üçÖ What is Pomopy?
Pomopy is a fun ASCII-art-filled, customizable time-management solution to optimize productivity. The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s and emphasizes working and taking breaks in regular intervals. 

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sophiezhng/pomopy
cd pomopy
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
```bash
pomopy
```

## üå± How it's built
This Pomodoro timer was built in Python using the playsound library to play an alarm effect after each interval. It saves your preferences in a JSON file locally so that you can start and stop easily. Use the `help` command to see all of available commands.

## Available Commands:
Make sure your volume is unmuted to hear when the timer goes off!

### Basic Commands:
`start` - Begin the timer from start of work period

`stop` - End Pomodoro timer

`remaining` - Remaining time left until next interval

`pause` - Pause the timer temporarily until resume

`resume` - Continue from where you left off

`mute` - Mute the alarm between every interval.

`unmute` - Default setting: Alarm rings between each interval.

`clear` - Clear the terminal

`quit` - Quit the program

### Customize Settings:
`set work [number of mins]` - Change length of work period

`set break [number of mins]` - Change length of break period

`auto off` - Manually switch between working and breaks

‚û™ if enabled, must use `start work` or `start break`

`auto on` - Default setting: automatically switchs between work and break periods in succession

### More Info:
`about` - Purpose of the program, author, credits, and more

### Fun Features:
`tomato` - Recieve a mysterious tomato

`hack` and `hack save` - Trick your friends into thinking you are a hacker by saving a custom message in advance and entering `hack` when you are ready.

## üçù What's next for Pomopy 
Future goals, subject to change include:
1. Adding Desktop Notifications
2. Package for more convenient installation
3. Simplify code to be shorter and more concise
