## üçÖ What is Pomopy?
Pomopy is a fun ASCII-art-filled, customizable time-management solution to optimize productivity. The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s and emphasizes working and taking breaks in regular intervals. 

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sophiezhng/pomopy
cd pomopy
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
```bash
pomopy
```

Make sure your volume is unmuted to hear when the timer goes off!

## üå± How it's built
This Pomodoro timer was built in Python using the playsound library to play an alarm effect after each interval. It saves your preferences in a JSON file locally so that you can start and stop easily. Use the `help` command to see all of available commands.
